Omarchy Quattro bar widget for today's [Obsidian daily note](https://obsidian.md/help/plugins/daily-notes) todos: view open items, add new checkboxes, and toggle them from a bar panel.

## Requirements

- Omarchy Quattro (Quickshell-based shell) on Linux
- An Obsidian vault with the Daily notes core plugin configured
- A supported architecture: x86_64 or aarch64 (arm64)
- Vault path via the `vaultPath` bar setting **or** `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_ROOT` for the graphical session — see [Set the vault path](#set-the-vault-path)

Daily note location and date format are read from `.obsidian/daily-notes.json` (`folder`, `format`, optional `template`), relative to the vault root. An optional archive location can be configured via the `archiveFolder` bar setting — see [Archived notes](#archived-notes).

## Architecture

- **Rust backend** (`obsidian-daily-qs`): resolves today's note, parses markdown checkboxes, adds/toggles items, streams JSON snapshots. Released as per-architecture static musl binaries (`linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`).
- **QML frontend** (`omarchy/`): `bar-widget` with a details panel. Left-click opens the panel. Architecture detection runs once at startup via `uname -m`.

```
obsidian-daily-qs watch ──(JSON lines)──▶ BarWidget ─▶ Panel
obsidian-daily-qs add|toggle ──(JSON line)──▶ BarWidget
```

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/LucaNerlich/obsidian-daily-qs.git --enable
```

Update / remove:

```bash
omarchy plugin update luca.obsidian-daily
omarchy plugin remove luca.obsidian-daily
```

If the bar still shows an error right after an update, run `omarchy restart shell` once. Omarchy hot-reloads plugin QML in place; a full shell restart is the reliable way to drop a stale in-memory widget (for example after the 1.7 backend rename).

The plugin bundles statically linked musl builds of its backend for x86_64 and aarch64 (`omarchy/bin/obsidian-daily-qs-<arch>`), plus an unsuffixed `omarchy/bin/obsidian-daily-qs` shim that execs the matching arch binary (so a hot-reloaded pre-1.7 widget keeps working). The widget prefers the arch-specific ELF via `uname -m`. If that cannot start, it tries `obsidian-daily-qs` on `PATH` once (`cargo install --path .`); if both fail, it latches to an error state instead of restarting forever. On unsupported architectures the bar shows `⚠ arch` with a tooltip explaining the problem.

### Set the vault path

Prefer the bar setting (no Hyprland env needed):

```bash
omarchy bar set luca.obsidian-daily vaultPath '/home/you/Documents/notizen'
```

Or set it from the panel when the widget shows the setup empty state.

The backend also accepts `--vault <path>` and still reads `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_ROOT` when `vaultPath` is empty. The Omarchy shell runs as a child of Hyprland, so an `export` in `~/.bashrc` does **not** reach it unless you also set the graphical session env:

**Option A — Hyprland env** (per-session, applies without logging out):

```lua
-- ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua
hl.env("OBSIDIAN_VAULT_ROOT", "/home/you/Documents/notizen")
```

```bash
hyprctl reload && omarchy restart shell
```

**Option B — systemd user environment** (applies at next login):

```ini
# ~/.config/environment.d/obsidian-vault.conf
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_ROOT=/home/you/Documents/notizen
```

### Archived notes

If you move old daily notes out of the live daily-notes folder (for example
into `dailies/_archive/2026/`), tell the widget where they went via the
`archiveFolder` bar setting:

```bash
omarchy bar set luca.obsidian-daily archiveFolder 'dailies/_archive/YYYY'
```

- The value is a folder pattern relative to the vault root, using the same
  moment-style tokens as the note format (`YYYY`, `YY`, `MMMM`, `MMM`, `MM`,
  `M`, `dddd`, `ddd`, `DD`, `D`). The formatted note file name is appended,
  so with `format: "YYYY-MM-DD"` the example above resolves `2026-08-20` to
  `dailies/_archive/2026/2026-08-20.md`.
- The live path always wins: when a note exists in both places the live one is
  used, and new notes are always created in the live folder.
- Archived days are fully usable: the week strip shows their open/done
  counts, and toggling, adding, editing, indenting, undo and open-in-Obsidian
  all work on the archived note in place.
- Leaving the setting empty keeps the default behavior of only looking in the
  live daily-notes folder.
- The backend also accepts the pattern directly as `--archive-folder` for
  CLI use, e.g. `obsidian-daily-qs status --date 2026-08-19 --archive-folder 'dailies/_archive/YYYY'`.

## Usage

- **Bar**: Obsidian mark + done/total for today. Left-click opens the panel; middle/right-click opens the note in Obsidian.
- **Panel**:
  - List todos; click a row (or move the keyboard cursor) to select it,
    click its checkbox or press Enter/Space to toggle. Hover a truncated
    row to see the full text.
  - Sort order is file order by default, so new todos append to the bottom.
    Cycle newest-first / uncompleted-first / alphabetical with the sort button next to
    *Hide done*, or set `sortOrder` (`default`, `newest`, `openFirst`, `alphabetical`).
    Parent-child hierarchy is preserved in every order.
  - Nested todos render indented; Shift+Enter adds under the selected row.
  - New items go under the configured `insertHeading` (or `todoHeading` when
    `insertHeading` is empty). When both are empty, the built-in `Tasks`/`Todos`
    section is used, falling back to the first todo list (usually at the top).
    Spacing is copied from that list, or from recent daily notes when starting
    a new one.
  - Right-click a row to delete it or move it to tomorrow (children included).
    Hovering (or selecting) a row also reveals an inline ✕ delete button.
  - `e` edits, `x` deletes, `[`/`]` outdent/indent, `u` undoes the last mutation
    (undoing a defer restores both days; a tomorrow note created by the
    defer is deleted again).
  - Week strip jumps between days; ◀ / ● / ▶ also navigate.
  - The *Inbox* cell left of the week strip shows `Inbox.md` in the vault
    root (created on the first added todo). Right-click → *Move to today*
    moves an inbox todo into today's daily note.
  - Search: `/`; open-only toggle; carry over; open in Obsidian. Carry over
    shows on today when a previous daily note still holds open todos — it
    uses the most recent such note within the last 30 days (weekend/vacation
    gaps), nearest first; repeat to drain older backlog. Opening a
    missing day creates its note from the configured daily-note template.
- **Settings** (`omarchy bar set luca.obsidian-daily …`): `vaultPath`, `archiveFolder`, `openOnly`, `sortOrder`, `todoHeading`, `insertHeading`, `hideWhenDone`, `hideWhenEmpty`.

```bash
omarchy bar set luca.obsidian-daily openOnly true
omarchy bar set luca.obsidian-daily sortOrder newest
omarchy bar set luca.obsidian-daily todoHeading Todos
omarchy bar set luca.obsidian-daily insertHeading Inbox
```

`todoHeading` filters which todos the bar and panel show. `insertHeading`
names the markdown heading new todos are added under (e.g. `Inbox`); when
empty it follows `todoHeading`, and when both are empty new todos use the
built-in `Tasks`/`Todos` placement. Missing headings fall back silently, so
existing notes keep their behavior.

## CLI

```bash
export OBSIDIAN_VAULT_ROOT="/path/to/vault"
# or: obsidian-daily-qs --vault /path/to/vault …
obsidian-daily-qs status
obsidian-daily-qs status --date 2026-08-19 --heading Todos
obsidian-daily-qs watch
obsidian-daily-qs add --text "Ship plugin"
obsidian-daily-qs add --text "Inbox item" --heading Inbox
obsidian-daily-qs add --text "Nested" --under-line 12
# Widget path: pass sensitive fields on stdin so they never appear in argv
printf '%s' '{"text":"Ship plugin"}' | obsidian-daily-qs add --stdin
obsidian-daily-qs toggle --line 12
obsidian-daily-qs edit --line 12 --text "Renamed" --expect-text "Old"
printf '%s' '{"text":"Renamed","expectText":"Old"}' | obsidian-daily-qs edit --line 12 --stdin
obsidian-daily-qs delete --line 12
obsidian-daily-qs defer --line 12
obsidian-daily-qs defer --line 12 --heading Inbox
obsidian-daily-qs indent --line 12
obsidian-daily-qs outdent --line 12

```

## Development

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets
node omarchy/model.test.mjs
omarchy plugin validate .
qmllint -I "$OMARCHY_PATH/shell" omarchy/BarWidget.qml omarchy/Panel.qml
```

`make bundle` rebuilds the musl backends for x86_64 and aarch64 into `omarchy/bin/` (Linux). `make verify-bundle` is the marketplace gate. Any edit under `src/`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, or `rust-toolchain.toml` requires a fresh `make bundle` in the same change.

### Releasing

1. Bump `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `manifest.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Run `make bundle` then `make verify-bundle` on Linux.
3. Open a PR; wait for the **marketplace bundle** CI job to be green.
4. Merge, then tag `vX.Y.Z` matching the crate version.
