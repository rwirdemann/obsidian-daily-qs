# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Inbox: an *Inbox* cell left of the week strip shows the vault's `Inbox.md`
  (vault root) with the same check / add / edit / delete / indent / undo
  actions as a daily note. *Move to today* moves an inbox todo (with its
  children) into today's daily note. The cell shows the inbox's open count.
- Backend: global `--inbox` flag targets `Inbox.md` instead of a daily note;
  `defer --inbox` moves the todo into the daily note for `--date` (default
  today). Inbox snapshots carry `"inbox": true` and no `date`.

## [1.12.2] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Atomic note writes create the sibling temp file with the existing note's
  mode (or owner-only `0600` for new notes) before writing content, so a
  private `0600` note is never briefly world-readable under a typical umask
  while the temp exists (#7777).

## [1.12.1] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Adding, editing, and other mutations no longer pass todo text (or
  `--expect-text`) on the process command line from the bar widget. The
  widget sends those fields as JSON on stdin (`--stdin`), so private vault
  contents are not readable via `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` on systems without
  `hidepid`. CLI `--text` / `--expect-text` remain for interactive use.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Opening the daily note in Obsidian no longer blocks the widget: `xdg-open`
  is spawned and not waited on, so desktop handlers that keep `xdg-open`
  alive for Obsidian's lifetime can no longer stall task refreshes (and
  other actions) while Obsidian is open.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Alphabetical sort order: new `alphabetical` `sortOrder` value (A–Z,
  case-insensitive, `alpha` also accepted). Top-level todos sort A–Z and each
  child group sorts A–Z under its parent, preserving hierarchy like the other
  orders. The in-panel sort button cycles through it as well.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Configurable todo sort order: new `sortOrder` bar setting with `default`
  (file order, new todos append to the bottom), `newest` (newest first),
  and `openFirst` (uncompleted first, then newest). An in-panel sort button
  next to *Hide done* cycles through the orders. Parent-child hierarchy is
  preserved in every order.
- Inline delete button: hovering (or selecting) a todo row reveals a ✕
  button that deletes the todo (with children) without opening the context
  menu. Right-click menu still offers delete and *Do tomorrow*.

### Changed

- Clicking a todo row now only selects it; completion toggles via the
  checkbox (or Enter/Space on the keyboard selection). Double-click still
  edits in place. Hovering a truncated row shows the full text in a tooltip
  while the row itself stays single-line elided.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-09-19

### Changed

- Carry over now uses the most recent previous daily note with open todos
  (last found, up to 30 days back) instead of yesterday only, so weekend or
  vacation gaps no longer hide the button. Nearest day first; repeat to drain
  older backlog. First write of a new day rolls the same source over.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- Configurable insert heading: a new `insertHeading` bar setting names the
  markdown heading new todos are added under (e.g. `Inbox`). When empty it
  follows `todoHeading`; when both are empty the built-in `Tasks`/`Todos`
  placement applies. `add`, `carry-over`, and `defer` accept `--heading` for
  the same per-command override. A missing heading falls back silently, and
  an explicit `--under-line` parent still wins over the section.
- Right-click a todo in the panel to delete it, or move it to tomorrow
  (`Do tomorrow`). Nested children move with the parent. Tomorrow's note
  is created from the daily-note template when missing, without rolling
  over the rest of today's list.
- CLI: `obsidian-daily-qs defer --line N` moves a todo to the next day.

### Changed

- New todos append to the first checkbox list in the note (typically under
  the date heading) instead of the end of the file, so later chapters stay
  below the list.
- Spacing between todos is copied from the current note, or from recent
  daily notes when the list is still empty — compact lists stay compact.

### Fixed

- Defer and add now respect the archive folder: when a note exists only in
  the archive, they edit it in place instead of creating a live duplicate.
  Deferred items use the same first-list placement and spacing as new todos.
- Undoing a defer restores both days (a tomorrow note created by the defer
  is deleted again). Undo records from previous versions still restore.
- A failed defer rolls the destination back instead of leaving the item in
  both days, and deferring onto the same note is refused.
- Left-clicking a todo while its context menu is open only dismisses the
  menu instead of also toggling the row.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Opening a date whose daily note does not exist now creates it from the
  configured daily-note template before launching Obsidian.
- Panel: use the PanelHero meta for the displayed daily date instead of a
  stale source.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Archive folder support: configure an optional archive location via the new
  `archiveFolder` bar setting (or `--archive-folder` on the backend), e.g.
  `omarchy bar set luca.obsidian-daily archiveFolder 'dailies/_archive/YYYY'`.
  Past daily notes that were manually moved out of the live daily-notes
  folder are then still found: the week strip shows their todo counts, and
  toggling/adding/editing/undo and open-in-Obsidian work on archived notes in
  place. The pattern supports the same moment-style tokens as the note format
  (`YYYY`, `MM`, `DD`, …); the live note always wins when it exists in both
  places, and new notes are still created in the live folder. Leaving the
  setting empty keeps the previous behavior.

### Fixed

- Week strip: days whose note exists but only holds done todos (typical for
  archived notes) now show a hollow dot instead of rendering blank like
  missing notes.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Ship an unsuffixed `omarchy/bin/obsidian-daily-qs` shim that execs the
  arch-matched ELF, so a hot-reloaded pre-1.7 widget (still looking for the
  old binary name after `omarchy plugin update`) keeps working without an
  immediate `omarchy restart shell`.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Linux aarch64 (arm64) support: the bundled backend now ships as
  per-architecture static musl binaries (`obsidian-daily-qs-x86_64`,
  `obsidian-daily-qs-aarch64`), and the widget picks the one matching the
  host CPU (via `uname -m`) at startup.

### Changed

- The todo capture field stays pinned below the scrolling list instead of
  scrolling out of view, and a normal addition is appended at the end of the
  Tasks/Todos section instead of the top.
- Simplified the panel UI: header, search, summary, and the hide-done filter
  stay fixed while only the todo list scrolls; search and the summary are
  hidden for short or empty lists; removed separators and base row indentation
  so hover backgrounds bleed into the panel inset.

### Fixed

- On an unsupported or misdetected architecture, or when the bundled backend
  cannot execute, the bar now shows a clear `⚠ arch` state with an explanatory
  tooltip instead of retrying forever; the PATH fallback now latches after
  both candidates fail instead of oscillating.
- Appending a todo under a heading whose section contains a fenced code block
  no longer mistakes a heading-like line inside the fence (e.g. a shell or
  Python comment) for the end of the section.
- Clearing the search filter when it becomes unavailable (short todo list) no
  longer strands keyboard focus on the now-hidden search field.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- `vaultPath` bar setting and global `--vault` CLI flag (env `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_ROOT` remains a fallback).
- Setup empty state in the panel when the vault path is missing or invalid.
- Keyboard list cursor: j/k or arrows move, Enter/Space toggles, `e` edits, `x` deletes, `[`/`]` outdent/indent, `u` undoes.
- Nested add via Shift+Enter (under the selected todo) and `--under-line` on `add`.
- `edit`, `delete`, `indent`, `outdent`, `undo`, and `week` backend commands.
- Week strip in the panel for jumping between days.
- Optional `todoHeading` filter; `hideWhenDone` / `hideWhenEmpty` bar concealment.
- Middle/right-click on the bar opens the note in Obsidian; progress cue on the icon.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- Bar label uses the Obsidian mark (theme-tinted PathSvg) beside the done/total
  count instead of a checkbox glyph.
- Panel layout matches other Quattro panels more closely: section separators,
  Open-only toggle switch, hoverable todo rows, and custom checkboxes.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- Carry-over into a day whose note does not exist yet no longer duplicates
  every carried todo (the note creation re-entered the rollover, appending
  each item twice and leaving the previous day's note already emptied).

## [1.4.1] - 2026-08-21

### Security

- `verify-bundle` checks the toolchain pin's semantic `components` line
  instead of any text match, so removing rustfmt/clippy from the pin is no
  longer masked by comments.
- All GitHub Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs.

### Fixed

- `watch` change detection keys on the serialized snapshot, so same-size
  checkbox toggles and carry-over count changes from edits to yesterday's
  note are emitted immediately.
- A watch backend that starts but crashes repeatedly now engages the PATH
  fallback and marks the bar stale (error state) instead of resetting to a
  healthy zeroed label.
- The panel clears a leftover search filter when it is reopened.
- One-shot commands exit quietly on a closed stdout instead of panicking
  on EPIPE.
- Atomic note writes no longer leave an orphaned temp file when the write
  or sync fails, and preserve the existing note's file permissions.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- Carry over now **moves** yesterday's still-open todos into the new day
  (preserving nesting) instead of copying them: the previous daily note is
  left with only its done todos. Open todos that already exist in the target
  note are not duplicated and stay in the previous note.
- Creating a new daily note (first write of a new day) automatically rolls
  the previous day's open todos into it.

### Fixed

- Note creation no longer creates directories outside the vault before the
  write check rejects the note: `ensure_note` canonicalizes the nearest
  existing ancestor of the note's parent and verifies it stays inside the
  vault root before running `create_dir_all`, so a symlinked daily-notes
  folder with a nested date format cannot leave stray directories at the
  link target.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-08-20

### Security

- Enforce the vault boundary on resolved paths: a symlinked daily-notes folder
  or note file that resolves outside the (canonicalized) vault root is refused
  for reads and writes. Atomic note writes resolve the parent directory first
  and create the temp file with `O_EXCL` (`create_new`) under an unpredictable
  name, so a pre-created `*.tmp-obsidian-daily-qs` symlink can no longer
  redirect a write outside the vault.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Panel search: `/` jumps to the search field (also from the empty add-todo
  field); matching is a case-insensitive substring filter that keeps
  ancestors of matches so nested context stays readable, and combines with
  the open-only filter. Esc clears the query and returns focus to the add
  field, a second Esc closes the panel.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- Todo text containing `&`, `<`, or `>` (e.g. `Team & Agile Meetings`) was
  dropped entirely and rendered as an empty checkbox. Todo rows are always
  `PlainText`, so such text is now kept (only control characters are
  stripped); error strings remain strictly sanitized.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Nested todo lists: checkbox indentation (tabs or two-space levels) is parsed
  into `depth` / `parentLine` per item, rendered indented in the panel, and
  preserved by carry-over. The open-only filter keeps ancestors of open items
  so nested context stays readable.
- Scrollable panel: content flicks vertically with a scrollbar when the list
  exceeds the panel height; Up/Down/j/k scroll while the input field is not
  focused.
- New todos insert under a `## Todos` heading as well as `## Tasks`.

### Fixed

- Arrow keys are no longer swallowed while the add-todo field has focus.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Bar label shows done/total (`☐ 2/5`).
- Panel day navigation (previous / today / next) with the same todo UX.
- Open-only filter in the panel (default via `openOnly` widget setting).
- Carry over yesterday's still-open todos into today (skips duplicates).
- Open the viewed daily note in Obsidian via `obsidian://open?path=…`.
- Left-click opens the panel with focus in the add field (quick capture).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Initial Omarchy Quattro bar widget for today's Obsidian daily note todos.
- Vault path from `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_ROOT`; daily note location from
  `.obsidian/daily-notes.json` (`folder`, `format`, optional `template`).
- List, add, and toggle markdown checkbox todos (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`).
- New items insert under a `## Tasks` heading when present, otherwise append
  at the end of the note. Adding creates today's note from the configured
  template when needed.
- Marketplace-ready musl x86_64 backend bundle with byte-identical CI
  attestation (`make verify-bundle`).

### Fixed

- Exit `watch` when stdout is broken so a crashed shell cannot leave a
  polling helper behind.
- Reject `..` / null path components from daily-notes settings so notes and
  templates cannot escape the vault root.
- Drop HTML markup from helper JSON before QML display and force
  `Text.PlainText` for note-derived strings.
- Reject multiline todo text so `add` cannot inject extra markdown lines.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Development scaffold (superseded by 1.0.0).
